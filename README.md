# Welcome to the Cloud Adoption Framework Guidance for Windows Virtual Desktop # 
We heard from our customers and partners to provide Cloud Adoption Framework guidance for specific scenarios and make it real. 

We have put together very detailed guidance and toolset that can help our customers and partners to deploy and manage Azure Windows Virtual Desktop(WVD) in alignment to Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) and called it 'The WVD CAF Solution Factory'. The WVD CAF Solution Factory takes you through all the phases of Cloud Adoption Framework detailing the steps that are needed for a successful Azure Windows Virtual Desktop deployment and management.  

## Artifacts Included
The WVD CAF Solution Factory, has the the following artifacts:

1. [WVD CAF Guidance Documentation](https://github.com/faridabharmal/WVD_CAF_SolutionFactory/blob/master/WVD%20CAF%20Guidance.docx)

   Detailed guidance about what one needs to do in each of the Cloud Adoption phases for WVD Deployment starting from Strategy, Plan, Ready, Adopt, Govern and Manage. We have supplied detailed step by step guidance(from our experiences) that will provide the steps necessary to go from zero to a complete WVD deployment and management aligned to the Cloud Adoption Framework methodology.
