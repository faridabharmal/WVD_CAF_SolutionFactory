# Cloud Adoption Framework Guidance for WVD
 CAF framework outlines key phases typically required/recommended to successfully implement and execute the WVD engagement.

## Strategy Phase
During the strategy phase, we try to understand the business through its motivations and outcomes. The underlying rationale behind the deployment of WVD in Azure is studied here.


## Plan Phase
Planning is the next phase which aids in building the roadmap to transform the strategy goals and business motivation into actionable items in alignment with CAF framework. This phase outlines the IT assets, users involved, their storage needs, resources required for managing and deploying WVD environment and assessment of the environment in detail.


## Ready Phase
This is an important phase where the ground level work is done to ensure that gaps are addressed and support needs are provided before deployment begins. A stage that needs to be set up wherein the landing zone is defined by organizing resources and setting up Network and Domain control. This session also details about building VM image through which we can create multiple session hosts. 

## Adopt phase
This is the main phase wherein the actual deployment will take place whether it is in greenfield space or migration from a different setup. It starts with setting up the host pool and customizing it according to the deployment. A standard procedure for execution of greenfield deployment is described herein. Azure enables to migrate existing virtual desktop workloads to Microsoft Azure as part of Windows Virtual Desktop and so, the migration process, its patterns and best practices are described herein.

## Governance 
Governance creates guardrails that keep the company on a safe path throughout the journey. For organizations with existing policies that govern on-premises IT environments, governance should complement those policies. Security and Compliance guidelines are elaborated to keep your systems safe.

## Manage
Unless, we have a plan to manage the operations, the efforts put in planning, readiness and adoption will yield little value. In the end, patch management process is carried out for updating and patching the Session host VMs to avoid any security vulnerabilities and applying any configuration controls as required.
